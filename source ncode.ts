Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

      <title>Any document which may be used to identify a person or verify aspects of a person's personal identity. If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card. Some countries issue formal identity documents, while others may require identity verification using informal documents. When the identity document incorporates a person's photograph, it may be called photo ID.
 In the absence of a formal identity document, a driver's license may be accepted in many countries for identity verification. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification.</title>

      <title>Accounted Order is a uniquely identified record of the agreement of one party with another to receive products and services under specified terms and conditions. Order supports the sale of a flexible range of airline products and services that are not necessarily Journey based (e.g. subscription services). 
 Comment:
 A 'PNR', 'super PNR' and 'ticket' are all today's versions of airline implementations of aspects of an Order. 
 An Order may support non-homogeneity, i.e. each passenger in an Order may hold different sets of order items at different prices.</title>

Upon expiry, the Tax may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the Tax guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.
 
 This field should only be used when the Airline indicates that a Price Guarantee is available.</title>

Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

 Should the Base Amount guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.
 
 This field should only be used when the Airline indicates that a Price Guarantee is available.</title>

Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.
 
 This field should only be used when the Airline indicates that a Price Guarantee is available.</title>

      <title>The length of time the fee of an offer item is guaranteed. In the absence of the fee guarantee time limit, the fee is not guaranteed. Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.
 
 This field should only be used when the Airline indicates that a Price Guarantee is available.</title>

      <title>A uniquely identified record of the agreement of one party with another to receive products and services under specified terms and conditions. Order supports the sale of a flexible range of airline products and services that are not necessarily Journey based (e.g. subscription services). 
 Comment:
 A 'PNR', 'super PNR' and 'ticket' are all today's versions of airline implementations of aspects of an Order. 
 An Order may support non-homogeneity, i.e. each passenger in an Order may hold different sets of order items at different prices.</title>

Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

      <title>The length of time the fee of an offer item is guaranteed. In the absence of the fee guarantee time limit, the fee is not guaranteed. Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.
 
 This field should only be used when the Airline indicates that a Price Guarantee is available.</title>

      <title>The length of time the Tax of an offer item is guaranteed. In the absence of the Tax guarantee time limit, the Tax is not guaranteed. Upon expiry, the Tax may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the Tax guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

Upon expiry, the fee may no longer be guaranteed and either a new shopping process should begin, or the offer should be repriced resulting in a new Offer. 
 
 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

 Should the fee guarantee time limit extend beyond Order creation, the remaining length of time persists into the corresponding Order Item. The airline can increase the remaining length of time beyond the original time limit should they wish to.

      <title>A uniquely identified record of the agreement of one party with another to receive products and services under specified terms and conditions. Order supports the sale of a flexible range of airline products and services that are not necessarily Journey based (e.g. subscription services). 
 Comment:
 A 'PNR', 'super PNR' and 'ticket' are all today's versions of airline implementations of aspects of an Order. 
 An Order may support non-homogeneity, i.e. each passenger in an Order may hold different sets of order items at different prices.</title>
